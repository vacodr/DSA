# Is Graph Bipartite?
There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] colors = new int[n];			
				
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {              //This graph might be a disconnected graph. So check each unvisited node.
            if (colors[i] == 0 && !validColor(graph, colors, 1, i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    public boolean validColor(int[][] graph, int[] colors, int color, int node) {
        if (colors[node] != 0) {
            return colors[node] == color;
        }       
        colors[node] = color;       
        for (int next : graph[node]) {
            if (!validColor(graph, colors, -color, next)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
